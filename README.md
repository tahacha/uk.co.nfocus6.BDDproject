A Specflow based project that utilses a gherkin feature file to test two different scenarios on a demo ecommerce site. 

Selenium Webdriver was used to test the different interactions when navigating the site. POM classes were utilised to represent the different pages and their respective functions.

Feature file contents:

Background: Logged in 

Scenario 1: Checking a discount has been applied to items in the cart

Scenario 2: Verifying an order has been placed after going through the chckout process

The driver settings such as the browser used and URL are stored within the run settings file as well as the login details for the ecommerce site. The actual run settings file isn't apart of this repository.
